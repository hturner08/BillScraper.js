# Valid bill types
This library can parse 8 distinct types of bills: "hr", "s", "hjres", "sjres", "hconres", "sconres", "hres", and "sres".

Below is more detailed information about each bill type from the GPO.gov website:

#### Bills

 - House Bill (HR)
 - Senate Bill (S)

A bill is a legislative proposal before Congress. Bills from each house are assigned a number in
the order in which they are introduced, starting at the beginning of each Congress (first and
second sessions). Public bills pertain to matters that affect the general public or classes of
citizens, while private bills pertain to individual matters that affect individuals and organizations,
such as claims against the Government.

#### Joint Resolutions

 - House Joint Resolution (HJRES)
 - Senate Joint Resolution (SJRES)

A joint resolution is a legislative proposal that requires the approval of both houses and the
signature of the President, just as a bill does. Resolutions from each house are assigned a number
in the order in which they are introduced, starting at the beginning of each Congress (first and
second sessions). There is no real difference between a bill and a joint resolution. Joint
resolutions generally are used for limited matters, such as a single appropriation for a specific
purpose. They are also used to propose amendments to the Constitution. A joint resolution has
the force of law, if approved. Joint resolutions become a part of the Constitution when three-
quarters of the states have ratified them; they do not require the President's signature.


#### Concurrent Resolutions

 - House Concurrent Resolution (HCONRES)
 - Senate Concurrent Resolution (SCONRES)

A concurrent resolution is a legislative proposal that requires the approval of both houses but
does not require the signature of the President and does not have the force of law. Concurrent
resolutions generally are used to make or amend rules that apply to both houses. They are also
used to express the sentiments of both of the houses. For example, a concurrent resolution is used
to set the time of Congress' adjournment. It may also be used by Congress to convey
congratulations to another country on the anniversary of its independence.

#### Simple Resolutions

 - House Simple Resolution (HRES)
 - Senate Simple Resolution (SRES)

A simple resolution is a legislative proposal that addresses matters entirely within the prerogative
of one house or the other. It requires neither the approval of the other house nor the signature of
the President, and it does not have the force of law. Most simple resolutions concern the rules of
one house. They are also used to express the sentiments of a single house. For example, a simple
resolution may offer condolences to the family of a deceased member of Congress, or it may
give "advice" on foreign policy or other executive business.
