A JavaScript API to scrape and analyze bills in Congress. Works for bills from the 113th, 114th, and 115th congress. **THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. DO NOT DOWNLOAD YET**.

## Table of Contents

* `docs`: Holds markdown files that explain the project in more detail.
* `examples`: Holds example code.
* `lib`: Holds all Javascript files
* `misc`: Hold all graphics for the README.md
* `runner`: Holds javascript files used to test the library while developing
* `test`: Holds all unit tests.

## Why?
The current repository for bulk bill data is horrible to use for both citizens and developers. As shown in the gif below, bills are uploaded as XML files in a giant folder, which makes programming any projects that involves congressional data cumbersome.

### What does this project do
 * Returns full Congressional bill text and metadata from Congress.gov as JSON. For example, it converts the XML (on the left) into concise, usable JSON (on the right)

 * Parses bills for key points and ideas.
 * Powerful filtering and searching.
